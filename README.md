# Motivation
Our motivation for embarking on this project stems from a shared desire to provide students with a safe and accessible space to prioritize their well-being.

Through guided meditation sessions, calming exercises, mood tracking, and personalized wellness goals, students can embark on a journey of self-discovery and emotional well-being. One of our main goals is to create a supportive community within the app, where students can connect with their peers, share experiences, and find comfort in knowing they are not alone in their mental wellness journey. As we embark on this project, we are committed to creating an intuitive and user-friendly app that resonates with students and encourages them to prioritize their mental health.
